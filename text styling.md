## General

All user facing text is to be written in the particular style.

This style mainly parodies corporative language, aggressive or manipulative marketing and legal disclaimers.

The goal of text should still be achieved, e.g.:

- mod description should outline what this mod does

- description of items should outline that item mechanics

Nonsense flavor texts can be written after and only after the goal of text was achieved.
